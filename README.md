# Face-Recognition-Major-Project-2021
# Attendance system

In this project camera will use your image to match with database and then recognize and as you come infront of camera it will mark your name in the Attendance.csv file with date and time.

This project will take your name once only in the excel file if you want to use it for other day then you have to create new excel file beacuse no duplicates are allowed in this project and it will take the first entry after that no matter how many times you came through camera it will not mark you attendance.
